### Ordering a Random Product
Let's say we want to order a random product (*we don't advise you actually do this*).

First, we'll need to create an opfront session. The session handles all requests made to our API and manages your credentials if need be.
```python
from opfront import OpfrontSession

opfront = OpfrontSession()
```

Once our session is established, we'll need our store's product list in order for us to pick which one we'll order.
Since the `list()`Â method provided by the SDK returns a generator that handles all the paging logic automatically, we'll need to iterate once
over it to get the complete list of that store's products.

```python
products = opfront.product.list(store_id=42)
product_list = [product for product in products]
```

After getting the complete product list, simply use python's `random.choice()` function to pick one at random.
```python
import random

product_to_order = random.choice(product_list)
```

With our product chosen, we need to prepare our order according to the [order model](/api#order-model).

```python
order_data = {
    'product_ids': [product_to_order.id],
    'client_info': {
        'first_name': 'John',
        'last_name': 'Doe',
        'email': 'john.doe@email.com',
        'address': '1286, Ward Road',
        'phone': '4181234567'
    },
    'store_id': 42,
}
```

Once the order body is defined, we place the order.
```python
order = opfront.order(**order_data)
order.save()
```
